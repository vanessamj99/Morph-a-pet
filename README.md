##Morph-A-Pet
Have you ever had a tamagochi? If you have or have heard of it, you know it was fun to take care of the pet that grew continously. Morph-A-Pet is inspired by the tamagochi where it has a life, can be feed, needs to be cleaned, and can become more happy after the user plays a game. SwiftUI was used for the UI and the sprites were made from scratch for the game.
